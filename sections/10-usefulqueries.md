# Querying to summarize your data

Using the SQLITE REPL, let's see what the nypl_items table looks like. To load the database, first confirm that you are in the `database-practice` directory. Start the Sqlite program:

`sqlite3`

Then, type this text to open our database:

`.open file:nyplbd.db`

1. How many records are in the table?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nypl_items;
```

2. What do the records look like?

```sql
SELECT * FROM nypl_items LIMIT 3;
```

3. How many different languages do you have items in?

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT language FROM nypl_items;
```
